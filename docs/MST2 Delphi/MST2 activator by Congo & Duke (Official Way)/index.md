BEFORE YOU READ FURTHER:


1. On VW, press and hold `MENU` button on the display of your MIB2 for 3 seconds and then go to `Software Update/Versions` and take a look at `SW Train` string.

   On Audi use corresponding [button combo](/General information/Useful documents/Key combinations and shortcuts/) to open RED menu and then look into `Versions info`
2. Make sure train starts with `MST2` and ends with `D`. For example: `MST2_EU_VW_P0891D`. Only in this case, everything below applies to your unit!

:::tip
If your SW Train ends with `T` (for example `MST2_EU_VW_ZR_P0254T`) your unit is Technisat/Preh for which you need MIB STD2 PQ/ZR Toolbox).
